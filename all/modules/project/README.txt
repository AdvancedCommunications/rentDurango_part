This module provides a content type for Drupal sites, the "project"
node. Projects can have releases associated with them, and this module
provides various ways to search for projects and download specific
releases.

Project nodes can have issue tracking associated with them by enabling
the project_issue module (http://drupal.org/project/project_issue),
and can be integrated with a CVS repository by enabling the CVS
integration module (http://drupal.org/project/cvslog).

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.txt.

For instructions when upgrading to newer versions, see UPGRADE.txt.

Send feature requests and bug reports to the issue tracking system for
the project module: http://drupal.org/node/add/project_issue/project.
A TODO list can be found at http://groups.drupal.org/node/5489
