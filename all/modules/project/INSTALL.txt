Installation
------------

1. Place these files in modules/project:
     project.module
     project.install
     project.css
     project.inc

2. Enable the project module under administer >> modules

3. Grant the proper access to users under administer >> access control

4: If you wish to enable issue tracking for projects, you should
   install, enable, and configure the project_issue module
   (http://drupal.org/project/project_issue).


Upgrading
---------

1. Make sure you backup your database!

2. Copy new files to modules/project.

3. Login as the site administrator (user #1) and run the update.php script.

4. If you have previously enabled issue tracking for any of the
   project nodes on your site, you *must* install the project_issue
   module (http://drupal.org/project/project_issue). When you run the
   update.php script, project_update_4() will reorganize the tables in
   your database to prepare your data for use with the project_issue
   module.  See modules/project_issue/INSTALL.txt for more information.
