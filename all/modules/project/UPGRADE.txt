======================================================================
This file contains specific instructions for upgrading your site's
version of project.module to a new release.  You should always check
this file when you download a new version to see if there are any
specific things you need to know about a certain upgrade.
======================================================================

--------------------------------------------------
Upgrading to 6.x-1.* (from 5.x)
--------------------------------------------------
  Before upgrading to the Drupal 6 version of the project and/or project
release modules, you *must* first upgrade to the most recent official release
of the project module.

  The Drupal 6 version of the project module now uses the Views module for
project browsing.  To use Views, many aspects of how the project browsing
works had to be changed.

  * Access to the project browsing views is based on a new permission
    called 'browse project listing'.  You will likely want to give this
    permission to all roles that currently have one or more of the following
    permissions:
      'access projects', 'access own projects', 'administer projects'.

--------------------------------------------------
Upgrading to 5.x-1.1 (from 5.x-1.0)
--------------------------------------------------

  The 'Project e-mail' setting on the project edit page has been
removed due to a number of problems.  This setting was only used for
Project issue tracking, so it didn't belong here in any case.
Therefore, database update #5001 drops this column from the
{project_projects} database table where it is stored.  If you happen
to want to save this data for some reason, you should save it into a
separate table before you upgrade to 5.x-1.1 and run update.php.  For
more information, please see the UPGRADE.txt file in the project_issue
directory, and read the following issues:
- http://drupal.org/node/36619
- http://drupal.org/node/189210


--------------------------------------------------
Upgrading to 5.x-1.* (from 4.7.x-*)
--------------------------------------------------

  If your site is currently running 4.7.x-1.*, you will have the same
complications upgrading directly to 5.x-1.* as you would upgrading to
4.7.x-2.*.  Therefore, please read the instructions for upgrading to
4.7.x-2.* below.  You can still upgrade directly from 4.7.x-1.* to
5.x-1.*, but if your site makes use of releases, you will have to
follow the instructions at http://drupal.org/node/163616.

  If your site is currently running 4.7.x-2.*, upgrading to 5.x-1.* is
very simple.  In this case, the normal upgrade procedure should be
followed, see http://drupal.org/upgrade for details instructions.
Basically:

  1) Backup your site and database.
  2) Disable all of your project-related modules (project,
     project_issue, project_release, etc) -- in fact, it's safest to
     disable all contrib modules before upgrading to a new core series.
  3) Upgrade core to the latest 5.* release.
  4) Install the latest 5.x-1.* release of project and project_issue.
  5) Re-enable project, project_issue (and optionally, project_release).
  6) Re-run update.php for changes to the project-related DB schema.


--------------------------------------------------
Upgrading to 4.7.x-2.* (from the 4.7.x-1.* series)
--------------------------------------------------

  During the 4.7.x development of the project modules, a fundamental
change was made to the code, which resulted in the split between the
4.7.x-1.* and 4.7.x-2.* versions.  Previously, project releases were
represented via a special table in the database, and all of their
behavior was hard-coded into the project.module.  Starting with the
4.7.x-2.* series, project releases are now represented by release
nodes (see http://drupal.org/node/94000 for more information).

  To see if your site is affected, you should run the following query:

     "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM project_releases;"

     (This assumes your site is not using any table prefixing, alter
     the table name with your site's table prefix if needed).

  If your {project_releases} table is empty, your 4.7.x-1.* or earlier
site does not use releases and upgrading to the 4.7.x-2.* series is
quite easy.  In this case, the normal upgrade procedure should be
followed, see http://drupal.org/upgrade for details instructions.
Basically:

  1) Backup your site and database.
  2) Install the latest 4.7.x-2.* release of project and project_issue.
  3) Run update.php.

  (Please note that the 4.7.x-2.* versions of project and project_issue
must be upgraded at the same time.  For example, you cannot run
project version 4.7.x-2.* with project_issue version 4.7.x-1.*).

  However, if your {project_releases} table has records, you are using
the old releases system, and upgrading your site will be a somewhat
difficult process.  In that case, you should view the following
handbook page on drupal.org *BEFORE* you start upgrading:
