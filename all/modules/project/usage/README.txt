This module is *ONLY* useful to record usage statistics for a site
that has setup project/release/project-release-serve-history.php and
expects clients (for example, the update_status module) to check for
updates about available releases.

** MOST SITES SHOULD NOT ENABLE THIS MODULE **

For background, see http://drupal.org/node/128827

Note that the module currently requires mysql 5.x or greater in order to
display usage statistics.
