======================================================================
This file contains specific instructions for upgrading your site's
version of project_issue.module to a new release.  You should always
check this file when you download a new version to see if there are
any specific things you need to know about a certain upgrade.
======================================================================


--------------------------------------------------
Upgrading to 4.7.x-2.* (from the 4.7.x-1.* series)
--------------------------------------------------

  The 4.7.x-2.* versions of project and project_issue must be upgraded
at the same time.  For example, you cannot run project_issue version
4.7.x-2.* with project version 4.7.x-1.*.  Therefore, if you are
considering upgrading a 4.7.x-1.* installation of project_issue to
4.7.x-2.*, please consult modules/project/UPGRADE.txt.


------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrading to 5.x-2.* (from the 4.7.x-2.* and 5.x-1.* series)
------------------------------------------------------------

  The 5.x-2.* version of project_issue has three new module depencencies:
    1. Drupal core's Comment module
    2. Drupal core's Upload module.
    3. Comment upload module -- http://drupal.org/project/comment_upload

  These modules must be installed and enabled BEFORE you attempt to
  upgrade to 5.x-2.*.

  Unfortunately, Drupal core currently has a bug that prevents you from
  enabling a module when another module adds new module dependencies. So,
  if any of the three modules above were not already installed and
  enabled on your site prior to this upgrade, there's a bit of extra work
  involved:

    1. Go to the module administration page. If Comment module is not
       enabled, then uncheck the 'Enabled' checkbox for any modules on 
       which Comment module depends (this is listed in the 'Depends on:'
       section -- Project issue tracker will be one of these).
    2. Repeat step #1 for the Upload and Comment upload modules.
    3. Submit the module administration form.
    4. Check the 'Enabled' checkbox for all the modules that you disabled,
       and for the Comment/Upload/Comment upload modules.
    5. Submit the module administration form.

  If you try to upgrade without the new dependencies enabled, the
  upgrade will fail gracefully.  If this happens to you:

    1. Follow the instructions above to get the dependencies resolved.
    2. Go back to http://yoursite.com/update.php
    3. Click on 'run the database upgrade script'.
    4. Click on 'Select versions'.
    5. For the 'project_issue module' select box, select update 5200.
    6. Click on 'Update'.

  NEW SETUP FOR ISSUE EMAILS

  In the past, the "From" address of all project issue e-mail
  notifications was the address entered by the project owner in the
  "Project e-mail" field on the project's settings page. This created
  a privacy problem, because unbeknownst to them, their e-mail address
  was being revealed to other users subscribed to their issue queue
  e-mails.

  To correct this issue, all project issue e-mails now have a global
  "From" address.  This defaults to the global site e-mail, but can be
  customized using the "Reply-to address on e-mail notifications"
  setting on the Project issue settings page
  (admin/project/project-issue-settings).
