New Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install the Project module (http://drupal.org/project/project),
   which the project issue tracking module requires and depends on.

2. Enable Drupal's Comment module under admin/build/modules, which 
   the project issue tracking module requires and depends on.

3. Enable Drupal's Upload module under admin/build/modules, which 
   the project issue tracking module requires and depends on.

4. Install the comment upload module
   (http://drupal.org/project/comment_upload), which the project 
   issue tracking module requires and depends on.

5. Install the project issue tracking module 
   (http://drupal.org/project/project_issue).

6. Enable the project issue tracking module under admin/build/modules

7. Configure the status messages at admin/project/project-issue-status

8. Grant the proper access to users under admin/user/access

9. Enable the project issue to link filter in proper input formats at 
   admin/settings/filters.  If your site uses ANY node access
   control modules (including, but not limited to, Organic
   Groups, Simple Access, and Node Access), you should not enable
   this filter.  Furthermore, if your site does not give the
   'access project issues' permission to all users (including
   anonymous users), you should not use this filter.  In both cases
   this is because the output of the project issue to link filter
   is cached, and it is not possible to ensure that the user who initially
   viewed the content and set the cache has the same access permissions as
   another user that might view the (now cached) content.
