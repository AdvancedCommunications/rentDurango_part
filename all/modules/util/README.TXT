The utility module is a module that contains a bunch of utilities that are
simple to code, everyone wants, but nobody actually codes them.

Right now, we have the following utilities:
 * System module fieldset closer
 * Allow to enable/disable individual plugins' through admin/settings/util page
 * Automatically save height for resized textarea
 * and more

To create new utilities for your drupal site place your code in a .inc file
and into util/utilities/[YOUR UTILITY]/ folder
